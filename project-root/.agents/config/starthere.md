# Architectural Handover Document: The AI Software Factory
**Date:** October 2023 / Workspace Version: 2.0
**Context:** This document serves as the architectural history and operational philosophy of a highly disciplined, Multi-Agent State Machine environment. It outlines the decisions, rules, and structures designed to facilitate a single-node Agile Release Train (ART) focused on scientific and full-stack development.

*Note to receiving AI Agent: The human user will provide the raw contents of the `.md` files referenced below. Use this document purely to understand the system's underlying logic, constraints, and operational paradigms.*

## 1. Core Philosophies & Paradigms

### A. Prompt-as-Code & The Multi-Agent State Machine
We transitioned from a "chatbot" paradigm to a "codebase" paradigm. The `.agents/` directory acts as an immutable Operating System. Markdown files act as executable code, defining agent classes, system firewalls, and runtime configurations. The system operates as a finite state machine routed by a silent orchestrator (`@rte`).

### B. Semantic Referencing (Universal Portability)
Agent personas (`@dev`, `@sme`, `@brand`) are 100% generic. They contain zero project-specific logic. Instead, they use "Semantic Referencing" by reading `.agents/project_charter.md` on initialization. This makes the entire framework instantly portable to any new project by simply swapping the charter.

### C. Context Preservation & Token Optimization
AI memory bloats rapidly. We solved this via two mechanisms:
1. **The Silent Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Log:** Agents dump their step-by-step reasoning into a write-only log (`thought_trace.md`). They are forbidden from reading it back. This ensures high-quality logic without poisoning the active context window.
2. **Lossless Memory Compression:** When `@arch` compresses the session history, it is mandated to explicitly extract and permanently anchor hard scientific constants, equations, and dependency constraints before summarizing the narrative chatter.

## 2. Directory Structure & File System Firewalls

The workspace is rigidly segmented to prevent AI agents from shadow-refactoring or mutating code outside their explicit domains.
